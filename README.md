# Overview

This checklist serves as a way to structure internal code reviews while developing smart contracts. 

## Audit Log

The [audit log](./Audit-Log-Template.md) template is a standard workflow to follow when your code is being reviewed internally. It is designed to help you create a comprehensive audit log that not only improves code quality and security, but also facilitates understanding for external reviewers and auditors. Consistently maintaining a detailed audit log enhances the development process by explicitly stating all assumptions.

## Code Review Checklist

The [code review checklist](./Code-Review-Checklist.md) is a checklist to follow when reviewing someone else's code. It is designed to help you identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities in a codebase. The checklist is not exhaustive and should be adapted to fit the specific needs of your team.

The quality of any review session is dependent on the questions the reviewer asks. The broader their search, and more experience they bring, the more likely they are to find issues. The checklist is designed to help reviewers ask the right questions and identify potential issues.


### The Security Stack

As a smart contract developer, the more layers of security you have in place, the better. The Security Stack Articles parts [one](https://medium.com/@elliotfriedman3/a-security-stack-4aedd8617e8b) and [two](https://medium.com/@elliotfriedman3/a-security-stack-part-2-aaacbbf77346) give a good high level overview of the different layers of security that can be in place when developing smart contracts. The more layers you can stack on top of each other, the better.
